# Project Showcase: React + GraphQL

## Overview

Welcome to my React + GraphQL project. It showcases advanced proficiency in React, Redux, React Router, and Apollo Client. Testing is orchestrated with Testing-Library and Vitest. The primary goal is to prove skills in managing these technologies. The details of the tasks are outlined below.

## Task Description

1. Create a frontend React app and configure GraphQL.
2. Provide a login form for the user to interact with and log in.
3. Show the username and list user-specific contentNodes after a successful login.
4. Provide an option for a user to log out.
5. Lazy loading of nodes is implemented as the user scrolls to the end of the list.
6. Maximum performance optimization is achieved using Memoization Techniques.
7. List sorting is implemented, and it is achieved via drag-and-drop.
8. Sorted list persists after a page reload.
